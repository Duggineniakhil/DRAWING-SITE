 Drawing Website Project
 
Introduction
This project is a simple drawing web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to draw on a canvas, adjust the brush size, change the color, and clear the canvas. 
The project demonstrates basic coding skills and concepts related to HTML5 canvas, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
As a student, I created this project to practice and enhance my skills in web development. It serves as an interactive and fun way to explore the functionality of the HTML canvas element and JavaScript.

Features
Canvas Drawing:
Users can draw freely on the canvas using their mouse.

Adjustable Brush Size:
Increase or decrease the brush size using "+" and "-" buttons.
Brush size ranges from 5 to 50 pixels.

Color Picker:
Users can select their desired brush color using a color input tool.

Clear Canvas:
Clear the entire canvas with a single button click.

Dynamic Brush Updates:
The displayed brush size dynamically updates as users change it.

Conclusion
This project was an exciting and hands-on learning experience. It helped solidify my understanding of front-end development concepts, especially working with the HTML5 canvas and 
JavaScript event handling. Iâ€™m proud of this small but meaningful step in my journey as a web developer.
